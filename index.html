								<p>ABOUT ME</p>
								<h2>Welcome</h2>
							</header>
							<p>As a second year computer science student at Aston University, I have learnt the value of building through design during my degree.  I have been lucky to study my passion and create opportunities for myself in the technology sector of employment. As seen below you will see freelance work which has earned me both financial and inner success. A sense of creating from a ‘blank canvas’ in the most loosest of usage is evident in the lives of programmers, but as you grow and develop your skills, you can see the difference from your first, and most recent project.</p>

							<p>But you may ask how does a passion even begin? I personally believe that passion starts with the excitement and motivation to achieve something, a simple goal or even the wildest of dreams, passion begins from within. For me I’ve always been creative and building something worthwhile is a desire for everyone. People are synonymous with their goals and I spent my early adulthood practicing and learning the most basic aspects of coding. Some people would lose interest at this point but I was not one of those people, instead I strived to carry on until I built my first website. After grueling weeks of text editing, I built a website about the reasons to travel to Japan. It was not my best piece of work but it was the catalyst in my skills transitioning from then to now.</p>

							<p>Fast forward to the current day where I have been given payment for my work as a freelance web developer. It was not easy by any means as I still have a minor reputation in the world of programming but if you are willing to work and prove yourself then you can make connections and create job opportunities for yourself. If anyone wants to hire me for my services, contact details can be found below and no prospect is impossible for a student with passion in their field.</p>
